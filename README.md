# React Native FlatList Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Native where a FlatList component fails to render data after a successful API fetch. The application fetches data correctly, but the FlatList remains empty. This is often due to issues with data structure or component lifecycle.

## Bug Description
The `MyComponent` fetches data from a remote API.  The API response is successfully parsed into JSON. However, the `FlatList` does not display the data. No error messages are visible in the console.

## Solution
The solution involves verifying that the `data` state variable contains the expected structure and that the `keyExtractor` function in FlatList correctly identifies unique keys for each item.  If the data is an array of objects, the `keyExtractor` needs to return a unique string for each object.

## How to reproduce
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npx react-native run-android` (or `npx react-native run-ios`) to run the application.
4. Observe the empty FlatList.

## How to fix
